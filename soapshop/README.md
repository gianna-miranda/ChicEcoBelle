******My Project Crashing- Gianna Miranda
My project crashed this morning, it started off as a sass error, but then "Element type is invalid" Kept showing up on the screen along with a message saying "25 stack frames were collapsed". At this point I was freaking out.(you can find a screenshot of this image in my image folder 'public/image/newError.png'). I am not sure what I did for that error to show up. 
***Challenge: (what does collapsed mean? what does that error mean? how to fix it?)

At this point I turned to github to go back to when it was working, which I hadent done yet. The only push I had made was my skeleton. I used my broken code and my skeleton code to make this code. It is not my best I will be the first to admit it. I am very proud of this website, front end was more of a challenge for me and being able to put this together so quick was a great feeling. A feeling of success overcome by the nervousness/ emberacement of presenting this website incomplete. I will be refactoring this website until it is what I had invisioned it to be.
<!-- This project is a website made for my mother, Gilla Miranda.
